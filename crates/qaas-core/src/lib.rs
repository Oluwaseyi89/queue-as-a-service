//! The QaaS queue engine.
//!
//! This crate owns everything that makes QaaS a queue rather than a
//! network service: the FIFO/priority queue data structures, the
//! write-ahead log that gives them durability, consumer-group delivery
//! semantics, and (later) Raft-based replication for clustering.
//! Deliberately, none of that is network-aware — `qaas-server` is the only
//! crate that binds a socket or speaks a wire protocol. Keeping that
//! boundary means the engine can be exercised directly in unit and
//! property tests, and reused unmodified if we ever want a second
//! transport (e.g. an embedded, in-process mode) alongside the broker.
//!
//! Nothing is implemented yet. The queue data structures land in
//! `feature/in-memory-queue-core`, and this crate exists first so that
//! work — and `qaas-server`'s dependency on it — has a stable crate
//! boundary to build against from the start.
